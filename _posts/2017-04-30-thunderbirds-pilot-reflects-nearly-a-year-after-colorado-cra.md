  TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE, Florida -- Air Force Maj. Alex Turner has done it
  hundreds of times. The F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot took off June 2, 2016, for
  an Air Force Thunderbirds flyover during the Air Force Academy graduation. He
  was well-informed on the flying routine and communicated consistently with his
  teammates -- standard procedure for any flyover.
