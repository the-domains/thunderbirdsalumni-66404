  Celebrity News The skies has been clamoring for Buzz Aldrin's return and he is
  back (although a little lower than the moon this time) to be the oldest man to
  fly with the USAF Thunderbirds. Neil Armstrong's name certainly has a left an
  impression on everyone's minds but Buzz Aldrin is a very close second, being
  the second man to walk on the moon.
