  By: Andrew Joseph | February 26, 2017 4:22 pm Flyovers are common at major
  American sporting events, but the 2017 Daytona 500's flyover was absolutely
  one to remember. After Jordin Sparks performed the national anthem, the U.S.
  Air Force Thunderbirds flew over Daytona International Speedway and broke into
  an impressive formation at the perfect time.
